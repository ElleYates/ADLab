# ADLab
I've honed my skills in Active Directory administration through hands-on experience in a lab environment I created. Proficient in PowerShell, I've automated user account management seamlessly. Furthermore, I successfully implemented Remote Access Server (RAS) features to facilitate NAT/PAT support. Additionally, I adeptly configured Windows DNS, DHCP services, and File Servers, ensuring precise quotes and NTFS permissions.
